    <p class="lead light-text">
      Participants: 1 | Role: UX/UI Designer | Programs: InVision, AdobeXD, Adobe Photoshop | Description:<br />
      Redesigned a website from a well known pizza restaurant in Seattle WA, called Dinos Tomato Pie. <br>
      The original design does not represent the friendly and inviting atmophere.<br>
      The original website is chaotic, unappealing, and may be irritable to some users that are sensitive to flash animation. <br>
      Using restaurant's original content, application is designed to be easily accessible on various platforms with an appealing interactive design.<br> 
      To demonstrate a friendly and social atmosphere, the story page was created which is a social page between the restaurant's staff and their customers.

      A self-challenge to improve GoogleMaps Application with desirable user-friendly features and suitable visual design.<br> 
      Redesigned navigation path with clearer indicators such as arrows pointing to the destination instead of dots as the original's design.<br />
      Added parking garage features when user uses saved parking option with accesibility and effeciency in mind.<br>

    <p class="lead light-text">
      Participants: 3 | Role: Web Designer & Developer | Programming Languages: HTML/CSS/JavaScript | Description: <br />
      A website application to virtually tour The Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium.<br>
      Application was created within 3 days, and uses content from database and APIs for each animal (some APIs have a limit on requests and will show placeholder image). <br>
      Using map feature with coordinats in HTML and JavaScript I made a still image of a real Point Definace Zoo map into an interactive map.<br>
      The map has access to each animal on the map via a "click" or "tab" key from which users can further explore and learn about each animal.<br>
      The application also has a donation page where users receive framed badges in bronze, silver, or gold of the animals they donate to as a reward.
